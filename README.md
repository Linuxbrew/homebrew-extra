# Deprecated: Linuxbrew Extra

All formulae from this tap have been moved to [Homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core).

---

[Linuxbrew Extra](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-extra) is a collection of formulae for [Homebrew on Linux](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) that are not dependencies of [core formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core) and are specific to Linux.

## How do I install these formulae?

First, install [Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

Then:

```
brew install linuxbrew/extra/FORMULA
```

or

`brew tap linuxbrew/extra` and `brew install FORMULA`
