# Linuxbrew Extra

[Linuxbrew Extra](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-extra) is a collection of
formulae for [Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew) that are not dependencies of
[Linuxbrew core formulae](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-core) and are specific to Linux.

## How do I install these formulae?

First, install [Linuxbrew](https://linuxbrew.sh).

Then:

```
brew install linuxbrew/extra/FORMULA
```

or

`brew tap linuxbrew/extra` and `brew install FORMULA`
