### Bug reports:

Please replace this line with a brief summary of your issue **AND** if reporting a build issue include the link from:

`brew gist-logs <formula>`
(where `<formula>` is the name of the formula that failed to build).

Additionally, please copy any relevant error messages (truncated if necessary) into this issue and link directly to them.

### Feature/Formula Requests:

**Please note by far the quickest way to get a new formula into homebrew-extra is to file a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-extra/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

We will consider your request but it may be closed if it's something we're not actively planning to work on.
